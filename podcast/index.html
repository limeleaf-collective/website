          <p><p>In this episode, we discuss AT Protocol, a technology that underpins <a href="https://bsky.app">Bluesky</a> and many believe is the future of social media. ATProto pioneer Boris Mann <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bmann.ca">@bmann.ca</a> educates us about AT Protocol, where it's used, why so many people are excited about it, and even how it's pronounced.</p>
<p><strong>Breaking news</strong>: In the episode, we discuss software patents as they relate to ATProto standardization. Today, Bluesky published a <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/10-01-2025-patent-pledge">patent pledge</a> vowing to "not enforce any of the patents on any software invention Bluesky Social owns now or in the future." The pledge includes IP related to ATProto. Progress!</p>

          <p><p>This month, we talk about the state of computer science instruction in higher education, and how it's changing. What even <em>is</em> "computer science" these days? Do tech workers really need a degree in it? Should schools develop new degrees in topics like application development instead of coding and algorithms? Naturally, AI comes up in the conversation. We also cover some clever new robot slurs that have been making the rounds online. Don't be a clanker, give it a listen!</p>

          <p><p>In this episode, we explore paradigms in psychology and software development, with guest Laurie Smith, a human services expert and applied behavior analyst. The discussion traces psychology's evolution from behaviorism to cognitive approaches, and software's progression from procedural to object-oriented and functional programming, and, of course, artificial intelligence. We also explore emerging paradigms in psychology, computer science, and economics, emphasizing the need to measure success beyond traditional metrics.</p>

          <p><p>This month, we have a special episode with Mavreen Smiel. Mav is a Senior Test Automation Engineer and long-time veteran of the video gaming industry. She gives us an insider‚Äôs view on software testing past, present, and future. (Yes, including the impact that ‚ÄúAI‚Äù is having on software quality assurance folks.)</p>

          <p><p>In our inaugural episode, we introduce ourselves and talk about the conniving grubs at Grubhub and why fining Big Tech companies is useless. We talk about the fine public service work being done by Trifecta Tech. In our "Explain it to Me Like I'm John" segment, Blain and Erik go deep into the Meta "View As" security breach and resulting EU fine.</p>
