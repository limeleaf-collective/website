John started his career at [RSA Security][5] working on 2FA and cryptographic SDK products. In 2002, he joined On2 Technologies to manage the company’s proprietary video codec products, which were used by billions of users in Adobe Flash, Skype, and JavaFX. After Google acquired On2, he was the product leader for HTML5 video in Google Chrome and led the WebM Project (now the [Alliance for Open Media][6]) to develop the VP9 and AV1 open video codecs.

John joined [JW Player][7] in 2014 and led several product teams there before taking over JW Platform and growing it into a leading SaaS video platform with over a billion monthly active users worldwide. He founded Limeleaf with Blain and Erik in 2024.
