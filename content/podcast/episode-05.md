In this episode, we explore paradigms in psychology and software development, with guest Laurie Smith, a human services expert and applied behavior analyst. The discussion traces psychology's evolution from behaviorism to cognitive approaches, and software's progression from procedural to object-oriented and functional programming, and, of course, artificial intelligence. We also explore emerging paradigms in psychology, computer science, and economics, emphasizing the need to measure success beyond traditional metrics.
