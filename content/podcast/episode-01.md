In our inaugural episode, after introducing ourselves and the podcast,
we talk about the conniving grubs at Grubhub and why fining Big Tech
companies is useless. We talk about the fine public service work being
done by Trifecta Tech. In our "Explain it to Me Like I’m John" segment,
Blain and Erik go deep into the Meta “View As” security breach and
resulting EU fine.
