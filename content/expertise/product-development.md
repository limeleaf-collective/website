## Our Process

We solve problems for our clients using a process that prioritizes goals and outcomes over simply delivering features. Our approach uncovers the client's true needs to develop the most effective solutions.

We also believe that well-crafted requirements are the essential foundation for building great software products. Clear requirements require understanding the client's business and goals to ensure the end product aligns with the needs and expectations of its users and stakeholders.

From our experiences working on products at [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/ "Chrome website"), [JW Platform](https://jwplayer.com "JW Player website"), [Kinetic](https://www.wearkinetic.com/ "Kinetic website"), [RSA Security](https://rsa.com "RSA Security"), [ngrok](https://ngrok.com "ngrok website"), and elsewhere, we have learned that high-quality requirements greatly reduce scope creep, missed deadlines, and unhappy users.

1. **User Research**. Conduct surveys, interviews, and "design thinking" workshops to understand target users, their problems, and what success looks like. This discovery phase digs deep to identify the most pressing problems and define the outcomes needed to achieve the client's goals.

2. **Define Requirements at the Right Level of Detail**. Write requirements that are clear but not overly constraining. Categorize them as must-haves vs. nice-to-haves, use unambiguous language, and organize them well.
 
3. **Document Everything**. Use a standardized Product Requirements Document (PRD) template and project management tools to store requirements in an accessible, maintainable format.

4. **Iterate and Validate**. Share drafts with stakeholders for feedback to catch gaps and inconsistencies. Run prototype tests to reveal unclear or incomplete areas. Iterate to improve requirements.

5. **Translate Requirements Into User Stories**. Writing requirements as active user stories focuses on goals to accomplish, not features to build. This keeps options open and emphasizes user benefits.

6. **Write and Test the Code**. Because so much foundational and definition work has been done, this phase can be surprisingly short.

7. **Monitor Requirements Post-Launch**. Have processes for submitting, reviewing, and prioritizing new requirements based on real-world user feedback. Revise requirements if needed to ensure user goals are met.
