We're grateful to everyone who helped out during testing and to those who [contributed code](https://codeberg.org/limeleaf/apply.coop/issues) to help us build a product that we're incredibly proud of. As a thank-you, early access and Beta users can continue to use the promo code SOLIDARITY at checkout until October 1, 2025, to receive a 100% discount on new job postings.  

## Help Us Spread the Word

apply.coop can only succeed if we attract job seekers to the site. Please share the site with your co-op members, friends, coworkers, social networks, and anyone interested in helping us grow the cooperative economy. 

Our placement on search engines is improving, but it can always be better. Inbound links play a crucial role in improving SEO. Please ask people in your network to link to **https://apply.coop** from their websites, blogs, Reddit posts, discussion boards, and other public platforms, ideally using the link text, â€œGood people find great jobs at apply.coop."

We will continue to refine and add features to apply.coop in the coming months (and work on a few other cool products), but we are committed to keeping the app simple, accessible, and speedy.

We appreciate your help and support so much. The worker ownership revolution is underway!
