[We started Limeleaf](/blog/our-journey-to-establishing-a-cooperative-company/ "Founding Limeleaf blog post") to work with smart people on interesting tech projects that make a difference.

But we also did it to have fun, learn new things, and fall in love again with the web. 

Today we launched [Diggetal](http://diggetal.com/ "Diggetal website"), a subsidiary dedicated to these projects.

<!-- more -->

Diggetal started as an internal chat channel for brainstorming ways to earn what we call "passive revenue" to fund development of our larger projects.

First up is a daily word puzzle called Nounly. You can play at [Nounly.net](https://nounly.net "Nounly website"), but you'd also be helping us out if you boost it on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/products/nounly#nounly "Nounly on Product Hunt").

We also heard that calculators are popular, so we created a tongue-in-cheek one to tell you when (if?) you'll be a millionaire. ðŸ™ƒ Find out your date with material destiny at [beamillionaire.lol](https://beamillionaire.lol "Be a Millionaire website").

Will Diggetal generate meaningful income for us? Who knows. These projects will cost very little to develop and operate, though, so we think it's possible.

Happy Monday, enjoy!
