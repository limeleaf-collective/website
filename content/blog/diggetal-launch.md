[We started Limeleaf](/blog/our-journey-to-establishing-a-cooperative-company/ "Founding Limeleaf blog post") to work with smart people on interesting tech projects that make a difference.

But we also did it to have fun, learn new things, and fall in love again with tech.

Today we launched [Diggetal](http://diggetal.com/ "Diggetal website"), an initiative dedicated to tinkering around with small projects.

<!-- more -->

Diggetal started as an internal chat channel for brainstorming ways to earn what we call "passive revenue" to fund development of our larger projects. 

Diggetal venture #1 is daily word puzzle called [Nounly](https://nounly.net/ "Nounly website"). We'd appreciate an upvote on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/products/nounly#nounly "Nounly on Product Hunt")!

We also created a calculator to tell you when (if?) you'll become a millionaire. The site is tongue-in-cheek, but it also has an economic awareness angle. âœŠ Find out about that, and your date with material destiny, at [BeAMillionaire.lol](https://beamillionaire.lol/ "Be a Millionaire website").

Diggetal projects are fun, but will they generate meaningful income for us? Who knows. They will cost very little to develop and operate, so we think it's possible.

In the meantime, enjoy!
