[We started Limeleaf](/blog/our-journey-to-establishing-a-cooperative-company/ "Founding Limeleaf blog post") to work with smart people on interesting tech projects that make a difference.

But we also did it to have fun, learn new things, and fall in love again with the web.

Today we launched [Diggetal](http://diggetal.com/ "Diggetal website"), an initiative dedicated to tinkering around with these projects.

<!-- more -->

Diggetal started as an internal chat channel for brainstorming ways to earn what we call "passive revenue" to fund development of our larger projects. 

First up is a daily word puzzle called Nounly. You can play at [Nounly.net](https://nounly.net/ "Nounly website"). You'd also be helping us out if you boost it on Product Hunt at [https://www.producthunt.com/products/nounly#nounly](https://www.producthunt.com/products/nounly#nounly "Nounly on Product Hunt")

We also heard that calculators are popular, so we created one to tell you when (if?) you'll be a millionaire. The site is tongue-in-cheek, but there's an activist aspect to it, as well. ðŸ™ƒ Find out about that, and your date with material destiny, at [BeAMillionaire.lol](https://beamillionaire.lol/ "Be a Millionaire website").

Will Diggetal generate meaningful income for us? Who knows. These projects will cost very little to develop and operate, so we think it's possible.

In the meantime, enjoy!
