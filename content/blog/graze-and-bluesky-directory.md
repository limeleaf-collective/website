We are excited to announce that the fine folks at [Graze](https://graze.social) have integrated our [Bluesky Directory API](https://blueskydirectory.com) into their platform. 

<!-- more -->

With Graze, people and organizations can build, deploy, and manage custom Bluesky Feeds using complex filtering logic—all without writing a single line of code.

Graze is using the API to access our database of Bluesky Lists and Starter Packs, which we keep updated in real-time using the [official Bluesky data firehose](https://docs.bsky.app/docs/advanced-guides/firehose). Recognizing that most developers prefer an API for this kind of service instead of coding it themselves, we integrated one into Bluesky Directory. If you're interested in licensing the API, contact us at [hello@blueskydirectory.com](mailto:hello@blueskydirectory.com).

[Graze](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/31/custom-feed-builder-graze-is-building-a-business-on-bluesky-and-investors-are-paying-attention/) is [one of the most exciting startups](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/bluesky-feed-builder-graze-raises-1m-rolls-out-ads/) in the rapidly growing [AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/) product ecosystem. We couldn't have asked for a better partner to be our first API integrator.

Here at Limeleaf HQ, we’re discussing potential new features for Bluesky Directory and the API, as well as new AT Protocol projects. If you have any suggestions, [let us know](mailto:hello@blueskydirectory.com)!
