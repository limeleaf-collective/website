This a dark day for many of us in the United States. A government that
we believe will undermine the fundamental values of our country and
[harm vulnerable citizens][0] has assumed power. No one can predict the
future, but if [their stated plans][1] are any indication, we are in for
a tumultuous four years that could erase over a century of progress for
working people.

We refuse to let them discourage us or distract us from what we want to
accomplish with Limeleaf. In our view, the best way to resist the coming
chaos is to stay focused on [our goals][2],  support each other, and
contribute to our communities (real and virtual). Moderating our media
consumption probably won’t hurt, either.

We must also educate people about why the worker co-op model is a great
way to run a business (note that I didn’t say *corporation*), regardless
of political persuasion. [Research shows][3] that “Worker cooperatives
are more resilient to economic shocks, experience lower turnover, and
have higher productivity levels.”

There is a persistent cliché that co-ops are bastions of Socialism.
This is false. While many co-op enthusiasts lean to the Left, there is
nothing political in the [Seven Cooperative Principles][4] (the “rules”
for how co-ops are managed). The co-op community includes
anti-capitalist vegan Anarchists, but it also includes
[dairy farmers][5], [grocery wholesalers][6], [music retailers][7],
[bankers][8], [hardware store clerks][9], and
[many more kinds of folks][10].

We are seeing the [tech worker co-op][11] movement gain traction, which
is a reason for hope. Since we started Limeleaf last March, we have met
dozens of people who are members of worker co-ops or have asked for our
advice to start one. We’re noticing more mentions of co-ops in the news.
People are imagining ways the worker-owned model can be [implemented to revitalize struggling industries][12].

Today is also Martin Luther King Jr. Day; let us remember and honor Dr.
King's [bold activism for workers][13] and his
[hope for the future][14].
