We are beyond excited to announce that [Mubashar Iqbal ("Mubs")](/about/mubs/) is joining the Limeleaf family!

<!-- more -->

Mubs has over 30 years of experience in software product development. He is a highly skilled software engineer and [an accomplished independent product developer](https://iworkedon.com/@mubashariqbal), having launched over 90 products and earned the "Product Hunt Maker of the Year" title for 2016.

Mubs will bring one of those products to Limeleaf. He has been working on [Bluesky Directory](https://blueskydirectory.com), a "curated collection of all things relating to the Bluesky social media platform." We're excited to help him expand and refine Bluesky Directory and explore developing other products for [AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/guides/overview). Learn more about Mubs' journey developing Bluesky Directory on his [Bluesky feed](https://bsky.app/profile/mubashariqbal.com/post/3l7dvz2ageu2h).

Most importantly, Mubs shares our strong commitment to ethical tech practices, [building in public](https://buildinpublic.com), democratic management, and worker ownership. To that end, according to our [Operating Agreement](/pdf/limeleaf-operating-agreement.pdf), every Limeleaf member owns an equal share of the organization. This means that, as of today, all members own 25% of Limeleaf.

Learn more about Mubs's many interests and projects on his site at [mubs.me](https://mubs.me/).

Next week, we'll release a conversation with Mubs as a special [Limeleaf podcast](/podcast/) episode. Definitely tune in for that, he's a fascinating guy.

Welcome, Mubs!
