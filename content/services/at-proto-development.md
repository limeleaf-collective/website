The [AT Protocol](https://atproto.com) (also called ATProto, the technology that is best known for powering the [Bluesky](https://bsky.app) social network) represents the future of decentralized social networking, but building on this platform requires deep understanding of its unique architecture, data models, identity systems, and federation concepts. We can help teams navigate ATProto's lexicon system, DID implementation, Personal Data Servers (PDS), OAuth profile, and the complexities of building interoperable social applications.

## Our ATProto Expertise

With hands-on experience building the popular [Bluesky Directory](https://blueskydirectory.com) and other ATProto applications, we understand the unique challenges (and benefits!) of developing on this platform:

- **Real-time Data Processing**: We've built systems that consume the Bluesky firehose to process millions of profiles, feeds, posts, and other objects.
- **API Integration**: Deep experience with ATProto APIs, authentication, and rate limiting
- **Custom Feed Development**: Created and deployed custom algorithms for content discovery
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Designed applications that work seamlessly across mobile, web, and desktop platforms
- **Platform Interoperability**: Built systems that integrate with other ATProto applications and services

## Our ATProto Consulting Services

Here's how Limeleaf can provide strategic guidance for your ATProto initiatives:

- Review, validate, and provide strategic guidance on product rationale, system architecture, technical requirements, launch planning, and scaling phases
- Guide architectural decisions for PDS, App View, and Feed Generator design
- Mentor your development team through protocol-specific challenges and best practices
- Provide technical leadership on complex federation and interoperability challenges
- Offer strategic advice on ATProto ecosystem positioning and compliance
- Guide moderation strategy and content filtering implementation approaches

## ATProto Development Packages

We offer flexible engagement models tailored to your ATProto development needs.

Example project: Twelve-week engagement to design and deploy a multi-tenant PDS (tenant isolation, sharding strategy, backup/restore, and rollout plan).

- Product requirements review and validation
- Architecture and isolation brief (tenant model, quotas, noisy-neighbor controls)
- Identity and federation plan (DID handling, rotation, tenant-scoped allow/deny lists)
- Storage topology (per-tenant buckets/prefixes, encryption, retention, backup/restore drills)
- Compute and deployment automation (IaC, tenant config, blue/green or canary rollouts)
- Traffic management and scale (per-tenant rate limits, concurrency, capacity thresholds)
- Security and compliance (RBAC, audit logging, data boundaries, deletion requests)
- Observability (metrics by tenant, tracing with tenant tags, alerts and runbooks)
- Operations runbook (failure modes, isolation/throttle/migrate procedures)
- Testing and validation (isolation tests, uneven-load scenarios, DR exercise)
- Documentation and handoff (tenant onboarding guide, migration playbook)
