The AT Protocol (the technology that powers the [Bluesky](https://bsky.app) social network) represents the future of decentralized social networking, but building on this emerging platform requires deep understanding of its unique architecture, data models, and federation concepts. Teams often struggle with AT Protocol's lexicon system, Personal Data Servers (PDS), and the complexities of building truly interoperable social applications.
