                <p><p>This a dark day for many of us in the United States. A government that we believe will undermine the fundamental values of our country and <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/world/trump-to-sign-order-proclaiming-there-are-only-two-sexes/ar-AA1xx9vp" title="Trump to sign order proclaiming there are only two sexes">harm vulnerable citizens</a> has assumed power. While no one can predict the future, if <a href="https://www.project2025.org" title="Project 2025">their stated plans</a> are any indication, we are in for a tumultuous four years that could erase over a century of progress for working people.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>We refuse to let them discourage us or distract us from what we want to accomplish with Limeleaf. In our view, the best way to resist the coming chaos is to stay focused on <a href="/blog/step-0-of-starting-a-tech-worker-coop/" title="Step 0 of Starting a Tech Worker Co-Op: Define Your Goals">our goals</a>,  support each other, and contribute to our communities (real and virtual). Moderating our media consumption probably won't hurt, either.</p>
<p>We must also educate people about why the worker co-op model is a great way to run a business (note that I didn't say <em>corporation</em>), regardless of political persuasion. <a href="https://www.aspeninstitute.org/blog-posts/building-and-sustaining-worker-cooperatives-in-the-us/" title="Building and Sustaining Worker Cooperatives in the US">Research shows</a> that "Worker cooperatives are more resilient to economic shocks, experience lower turnover, and have higher productivity levels."</p>
<p>There is a persistent clich√© that co-ops are bastions of Socialism. This is false. While many co-op enthusiasts lean to the Left, there is nothing political in the <a href="https://www.electric.coop/seven-cooperative-principles%E2%80%8B" title="Seven Cooperative Principles">Seven Cooperative Principles</a> (the "rules" for how co-ops are managed). The co-op community includes anti-capitalist vegan Anarchists, but it also includes <a href="https://www.landolakesinc.com/">dairy farmers</a>, <a href="https://awginc.com" title="Associated Wholesale Grocers">grocery wholesalers</a>, <a href="https://downtownsounds.com/" title="Downtown Sounds">music retailers</a>, <a href="https://www.nafcu.org" title="NAFCU">bankers</a>, <a href="https://www.doitbestonline.com/" title="Do-It-Best">hardware store clerks</a>, and <a href="https://www.usworker.coop/en/" title="USFWC">many more kinds of folks</a>.</p>
<p>We see the <a href="https://platform.coop/blog/why-worker-cooperatives-in-the-tech-sector/" title="Why Worker Cooperatives in the Tech Sector?">tech worker co-op</a> movement gaining traction. Since we started Limeleaf last March, we've connected with <a href="https://patio.coop" title="Patio">dozens of worker co-ops</a> and aspiring co-op founders seeking guidance. <a href="https://www.thenews.coop" title="Coop News">Media coverage of cooperatives has increased</a>, and there's rising interest in using worker ownership to <a href="https://www.elysian.press/" title="The Elysian">revitalize struggling industries</a>. In fact, 2025 is <em>literally</em> the <a href="https://2025.coop/" title="Celebrating the International Year of Cooperatives">International Year of Cooperatives</a>. These developments are reasons for hope; when people are financially independent, they are empowered to oppose injustice, oppression, and corruption.</p>
<p>Today is also Martin Luther King Jr. Day; let us remember and honor Dr. King's <a href="https://www.pef.org/articles/holidays-remembrances/martin-luther-king-jr-day/" title="MLK fought for workers&#39; rights, bridging the labor movement with the civil rights movement">tireless advocacy for workers</a> and his <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/2025/01/20/alveda-king-reflects-on-uncles-teachings-of-hope-and-unity-on-mlk-jr-s-96th-birthday/" title="Alveda King reflects on uncle&#39;s teachings of hope and unity on MLK Jr.&#39;s 96th birthday">hope for the future</a>.</p>
