                <p><p>I was about 80% finished with this post and I was going down the road of
listing out all the great things both Go and Rust offer for us to build
and maintain software for our clients and product, but then I threw it
all out. I realized that posts like that are a dime a dozen and there
are so many resources out there comparing, contrasting, and listing
features of both languages, but none of that really explains WHY we, the
humans Erik, John, and I, like using Go and Rust. So instead I thought
it would be better to personalize this a bit and grab some quotes from
each of us about why we like each of them, unedited, unfiltered, and
raw!</p>

<p>Erik says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My first experience writing production code was with PHP and it wasn‚Äôt
until I was exposed to Ruby that I had my first ‚Äúah-ha!‚Äù moment that
there was a much more pleasant way to do things. Go was that second
moment. The standard library and its documentation (and generally the
community package documentation), static typing, and overall
simplicity of the language instantly clicked and felt like it made me
a more productive developer while making systems that were performant
and correct. Removing the need to pull in a myriad of external
dependencies and libraries and, in turn, having the ability to rely on
Go‚Äôs standard library for networking, I/O and testing has helped me
many times to quickly prototype a system I‚Äôm confident will work the
way I intend and is generally already production-ready.</p>

<p>John says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Go revolutionized the development of network services and web
applications. Its comprehensive standard library, simplicity, and
integrated testing tools (among other features) enable teams to
rapidly build and refine sophisticated, highly scalable network
software products with minimal bugs‚Äìthings that no Product Manager
will ever complain about.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Blain says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Go will always hold a special place in my heart. Switching from Node
to Go all those years ago made me want to return to college and focus
more on writing software with respect to the machines it is running
on. Even though it is a garbage collected language you can write Go
efficiently by understanding how and when memory is allocated and
deallocated. However, the biggest selling point for Go for me is the
amazing standard library that makes writing networking and I/O code
such a breeze with net, net/http, io, and bufio. I remember standing
by that once when I decided to live code a toy key/value database in
Go at a conference. Just a blast to write.</p>

<p>Erik says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Learning Rust has given me a new perspective on development. It‚Äôs been
another one of the ‚Äúah-ha!‚Äù moments along my software journey that has
made me more mindful in terms of memory and the ownership of data
within a program. Being able to write performant, safe code in a
concise and simple way is such a joy. The somewhat steeper learning
curve really pays off when you‚Äôre more confident and fearless in the
code that you‚Äôre writing.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>John says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a Product Manager, I‚Äôm excited about Rust because it opens up a new
world of interesting customers and projects for us at Limeleaf.
Developers writing in modern languages like Rust are at the leading
edge of innovation, using it to build everything from complex web apps
to IoT devices. It‚Äôs really fun and rewarding to mentor companies as
they implement the language.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Blain says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I actually really love the borrow checker. I spent a lot of years
writing backend systems with dynamic languages and I still have
nightmares about null references and panics in production. Even though
I like Go, it has its pain points with nil references as well. Rust‚Äôs
memory model in general is just fantastic at getting rid of an entire
class of problems and actually makes me a better programmer when
thinking about ownership. A language that can do all of that to be
used in not only distributed web applications and systems, but also
embedded microcontroller systems is a win/win/win in my book.</p>
